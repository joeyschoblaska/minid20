# Mini D20
A tabletop RPG system that fits on a single sheet of paper.

Mini D20 is meant to feel as similar to [Dungeons and Dragons 5e
SRD](http://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf) as possible.
This makes it a great system for introducing new players to D&D, or to use for
one-shots when you want a D&D feel but need rules that can be grokked in a few
minutes.

## TODO
* Replace some of the table rendering code with [stock Prawn functionality](http://prawnpdf.org/prawn-table-manual.pdf)
