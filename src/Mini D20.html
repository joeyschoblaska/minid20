<h2>Character advancement</h2>

<p>
  At level 1 you start with hitpoints equal to your max hit die (HD) + CON (eg:
  8 + CON with 1d8 HD). For each subsequent level, <em>roll</em> your HD and
  add the result + CON to your total.
</p>

<p>
  Get a +2 bonus to class skills at lvl 1, scaling to +3 at 5, +4 at 9, +5 at
  13, and +6 at 17. At lvl 9, choose an additional skill. At levels 4, 8, 12,
  16, and 19, increase one stat of your choice by 1.
</p>

<h2>Combat and recovery</h2>

<p>
  At the start of combat, roll initiative (DEX) to determine turn ord- er. On
  your turn you can take one free action, move (up to 30 ft), and attack (in
  any order). You can trade one attack for a second movement or non-free action
  (spellcasting, shapeshifting, using an item, etc.). To attack, roll 1d20 +
  STR or DEX to hit vs AC (need equal or greater), then your weap's damage die
  + same modifier for damage on hit. Ranged weapons reach ~60 ft and cannot be
  used if engaged by any opponent. One round lasts ~6 seconds.
</p>

<p>
  A natural 1 on an attack roll always misses. A natural 20 always hits;
  additionally, roll all dmg dice twice before adding modifiers.
</p>

<p>
  After a long rest (eight uninterrupted hours of sleep, max one per 24 hours),
  regain all hitpoints, prepare new spells, and reset abilities. After a short
  rest (one hour relaxing, max one per long rest), roll lvl/3 hit die + CON and
  restore that many hitpoints.
</p>

<p>
  If you drop to 0 hitpoints or less, you die.
</p>

<h2>Skill checks and saving throws</h2>

<p>
  For skill checks and saving throws, roll 1d20 + associated stat +/- any
  bonuses or penalties (from skills, class, race, equipment, etc.).
</p>

<p>
  The check or save succeeds if it is equal or greater than a difficulty (DC)
  set by the DM. If you have advantage, roll twice and take the better result;
  for disadvantage, roll twice and take the worse.
</p>

<div class="page-break"></div>

<h2>Spellcasting</h2>

<p>
  After a rest, you can prepare a number of spells based on your class and
  level. You can prepare up to three copies of a single spell each day. You can
  only cast spells you've prepared, and only up to the number of times you've
  prepared them.

<p>
  Bards, Paladins, Sorcerers, and Warlocks use CHA as their casting MOD.
  Clerics, Druids, and Rangers use WIS. Wizards use INT.
</p>

<p>
  Spells that damage one target are attacks: roll 1d20 + MOD vs AC to hit. If a
  spell calls for a save, the DC is 10 + caster's MOD. Ranged spells reach ~60
  ft. "Touch" spells require a free hand (one not holding a weapon or shield).
  Misses and failures still use up the prepared spell. Caster can cancel their
  spells' effects at will.
</p>

<p>
  Replace the "SL" in a spell's description with its level. You can prep these
  spells using a higher level slot for a stronger effect.
