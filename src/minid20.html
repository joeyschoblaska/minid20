<h2>Character advancement</h2>

<p>
  At lvl 1 you start with hitpoints equal to your max hit die (HD) + CON (eg: 8
  + CON for 1d8 HD). For each subsequent level, <em>roll</em> your HD and add
  the result + CON to your total.
</p>

<p>
  At levels 4, 8, 12, 16, and 19, increase one stat of your choice by 1.
</p>

<p>
  Your class gives you a +2 bonus to listed skills at lvl 1, scaling to +3 at 5, +4 at 9, +5 at 13, and +6 at 17.
</p>

<h2>Combat and recovery</h2>

<p>
  Ranged vs melee (DEX vs STR, cannot use ranged while engaged with any opponent). Rests ("per rest" skills mean "long rest"). Initiative. Movement + action.
</p>

<p>
  If you drop to 0 hitpoints or less, you die.
</p>

<h2>Skill checks and saving throws.</h2>

<p>
  For skill checks and saving throws, roll 1d20 + stat modifier and any
  bonuses or penalties (from class, race, equipment, etc.).

  The skill succeeds if it is equal or greater than a difficulty set by the DM.

  disadvantage, roll twice and take the worse.
