<h2>Character advancement</h2>

<p>
  At level 1 you start with hitpoints equal to your max hit die (HD) + CON (eg:
  8 + CON with 1d8 HD). For each subsequent level, <em>roll</em> your HD and
  add the result + CON to your total.
</p>

<p>
  Get a +2 bonus to class skills at lvl 1, scaling to +3 at 5, +4 at 9, +5 at
  13, and +6 at 17. At lvl 9, choose an additional skill. At levels 4, 8, 12,
  16, and 19, increase one stat of your choice by 1.
</p>

<h2>Combat and recovery</h2>

<p>
  At the start of combat, roll initiative (DEX) to determine turn order. On
  your turn, you can take one free action, move (up to 30 feet), and attack (in
  any order). You can trade one attack for a second movement or non-free action
  (spellcasting, shapeshifting, using an item, etc.). To attack, roll 1d20 +
  STR or DEX to hit vs AC (need equal or greater), then your weapon's damage
  die + same modifier for damage on hit. Ranged weapons can reach 60 feet and
  cannot be used if engaged by any opponent.
</p>

<p>
  A natural 1 on an attack roll always misses. A natural 20 always hits;
  additionally, roll all dmg dice twice before adding modifiers.
</p>

<p>
  After a long rest (eight uninterrupted hours of sleep, max one per 24 hours),
  regain all hitpoints, prepare new spells, and reset abilities. After a short
  rest (one hour relaxing, max one per long rest), roll lvl/3 hit die + CON and
  restore that many hitpoints.
</p>

<p>
  If you drop to 0 hitpoints or less, you die.
</p>

<h2>Skill checks and saving throws.</h2>

<p>
  For skill checks and saving throws, roll 1d20 + stat modifier and any
  bonuses or penalties (from class, race, equipment, etc.).
</p>

    <td width="10%"><strong>STR</strong></td>
    <td width="90%">Athletics, intimidation.</td>

    <td><strong>DEX</strong></td>

<p>
  The skill succeeds if it is equal or greater than a difficulty set by the DM.
  If you have advantage, roll twice and take the better result; for
  disadvantage, roll twice and take the worse.
</p>

<div class="page-break"></div>

<h2>Spellcasting</h2>

<p>
  Prepare spells after a long rest. You get a number of spell points (SP) per
  rest; each spell has a level, which is also to the number of SP it costs to
  prep. You can prep the same spell more than once (spending SP each time). You
  can only cast spells you've prepa- red, and only cast them the number of times
  you've prepared them. As you advance, you gain access to more powerful spells.
